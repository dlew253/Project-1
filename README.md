5. Gameplay is simple: on a double click the ball is sent randomly either left or right. Players control one paddle each with either W/S or Up/Down arrow keys. The object of the game is to score more points than the opponent by hitting the ball to their back-line. After 10 points have been scored the game stops. Manual reset with F5 is still needed at this point.

6. Obstacles faced: canvass rendering issues-- solved by scrapping canvas and going with simple styled HTML/JS functionality. Couldnt find images i wanted to sue for a stretch goal.
